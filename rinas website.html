I have a certificate for instructing yoga, so feel free to come to me for all your zen needs :D <br> I like conquering hard hikes
 or leisurely walking through some nature. <a href=https://www.alltrails.com>Visit all trails.com</a> when in search of a hike !<br> 
 Dylan and I have traveled for months at a time.<br> During this 
 period we usually spend it out in nature, giving us the opportunity to see some beautiful sights and do some miraculous things.<br>

<h4> Web Developing</h4>
<p> I am interested in web developing for the sole purpose of it being a demanding field.<br>
    I'm also trying to do something more with my life to have a sense of self-worth.<br>
    I also want to be able to take care of my mom as she has done for me for so many years.<br> 
    I also believe web developing is the way of the future and its something I want to be apart of.<br>
